Starting the 
development server
A sample test project is 
included into the source tree
so if you want to try you can simple 
start this test project
to do this you need to enter
the following commands:

```cd testapp
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver```

# Note
The development server is 
configured to
use sqlite database
so required packages
should be installed



(changed from to above: ```cd:testapp:python manage.py syncdb:python manage.py runserver:```)
