In this python django project we will create an expense tracker that will take details of our expenses While filling the 
signup form a person will also need to fill in the details about the income and the amount 
he/she wants to save Some people earn on a daily basis so their income can also be added on a regular basis Details of expenses will be shown in the form of a pie chart on a weekly monthly and yearly basis Installation of django is a must to start with the
Expense Tracker project
